# Hello and Welcome

The assignment I was given was to be creative and show off my personality while allowing my code to shine.

I believe this application will give you an accurate depiction of my personality.

Thus far in my experience I have focused on React, so I have implemented Vue within this library to show my ability to conform to your company's language requirements.

Thank you again for your time, consideration and the opportunity to become a part of your team.

# Before Analyzing the Code

To run (get the most out of) the application, if using VS Code, install the Extension: [Live Server](http://https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer "Live Server")
